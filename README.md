This simulator was written in JAVA. To run the simulator you will need to have java installed. 

This file comes with a .zip, included in the zip is the runnable jar, the project files, and a .txt for input. 
The .txt needs to be name test.txt and has to be in the file that contains the jar or it won't work. 

To run the program, go into a tersminal program. Navigate to where the .jar file is located. 

in unix based systems : java -jar Test.jar 
in windows based systems the command should be the same. 

The output should present itself in the command window. The use of -1 is for all unused locations so register values of 
-1 are not allowed in this simulation along with all calculations that could lead to a -1.
